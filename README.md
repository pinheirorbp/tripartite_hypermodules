# tripartite_hypermodules
In this repository we provide: (1) a set of functions for hypermodularity analysis, including functions for applying the HyperMod algorithm, generating null models and plotting the tripartite networks, (2) R scripts, data and RMarkdowns to reproduce step-by-step the analysis performed in the study.
